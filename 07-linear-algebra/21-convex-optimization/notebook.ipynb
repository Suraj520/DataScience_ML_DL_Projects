    "Convex optimization is a subfield of optimization that deals with finding the minimum of a convex function over a convex set. Convex optimization has many applications, such as machine learning, signal processing, and control theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Convex optimization involves finding the minimum of a convex function f(x) over a convex set C, where x is a vector in n-dimensional space. A function f(x) is convex if the line segment between any two points on the graph of f(x) lies above the graph. A set C is convex if the line segment between any two points in C lies entirely within C.\n",

    "Convex optimization problems have the form:\n",

    "minimize f(x)\n",

    "\n",
    "where f(x) is a convex function and C is a convex set. Convex optimization problems have many desirable properties, such as the existence of a unique global minimum and efficient algorithms for solving them.\n"
