#### About 
> Case study on Product analytics.

1. Problem statement - On a smartphone app that provides a subscription-based service, we are provided a Kaggle dataset. Users of the app can enjoy a variety of services, including personalised suggestions, access to premium content, and first access to new releases. In order to improve the app and lower churn rate, the company wishes to examine user behaviour and usage patterns.

2. Data Collection - User demographics, usage habits, and subscription information are among the details gathered from the app's server logs. It is available for download from Kaggle in CSV format.

3. Data Pre-processing - By deleting unnecessary columns, dealing with missing values, and handling outliers, the data is cleaned. To make the columns easier to read, they have also been renamed.

4. Feature Engineering - The model's accuracy is increased by generating new features from the existing data. These KPIs for user engagement include session length, session count, and frequency of app use.

5. EDA - Exploratory Data Analysis is performed to gain insights into the data and identify patterns. This includes analyzing user behavior and identifying trends in user engagement.

6. Model Selection - The data is split into training and testing datasets, and different machine learning models are tested to determine the best fit for the data. Models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees Regressor, Random Forests Regressor, and Neural Networks are evaluated based on their accuracy and performance.

7. Model tuning - The hyperparameters of the selected model are tuned to optimize its performance. This is done using techniques such as Grid Search and Randomized Search.

8. Model Interpretation - The selected model is used to interpret the data and gain insights into user behavior. This includes identifying the most important features that influence user behavior and predicting user churn.

9. Recommendations and Results - Based on the insights gained from the model, recommendations are made to improve the app and reduce churn rate. These include improving personalized recommendations, providing better access to exclusive content, and incentivizing users to continue using the app. The results are evaluated based on the accuracy of the model and the effectiveness of the recommendations.
