> Case study on AB Testing in e-commerce domain.

1. Problem Statement - An e-commerce company has developed a new landing page for their website, and wants to test whether the new page leads to more conversions (i.e., purchases) than the old page. The company decides to conduct an A/B test, randomly assigning users to either the control group (who see the old page) or the experiment group (who see the new page). The company wants to analyze the results of the A/B test and make a recommendation on whether to roll out the new page to all users.

2. Data Collection- The company collects data on user visits, clicks, purchases, and revenue for both the control and experiment groups. The dataset has the following columns:

- user_id: the unique identifier for each user
- timestamp: the date and time of each user's visit
- group: the group to which each user was assigned (control or experiment)
- landing_page: the type of landing page each user saw (old or new)
- converted: whether or not each user made a purchase (1 if yes, 0 if no)

3. Data Pre-processing - We start by checking the dataset for missing values and outliers. We also remove any duplicate rows and convert the timestamp column to a datetime object. We then perform some data cleaning and wrangling, such as converting categorical variables to binary variables using one-hot encoding.

4. Feature Engineering - We can create new features based on the existing ones, such as calculating the duration of each user's visit, or grouping users by the day of the week or time of day that they visited the site.

5. EDA- We can perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize the distribution of various variables and check for outliers.

6. Model Selection- We can choose a statistical test to analyze the results of the A/B test, such as a t-test, chi-squared test, or regression analysis. We can also use machine learning models to predict which landing page will lead to more conversions, based on features such as user demographics, behavior, or preferences.

7. Model Tuning - We can tune the hyperparameters of our models using techniques such as cross-validation or grid search, in order to improve their performance on the data.

8. Model Interpretation - We can interpret the results of our models to understand which features are most important for predicting conversions, or which landing page is more effective. We can also check the statistical significance of our A/B test results and calculate confidence intervals for the difference in conversion rates between the two groups.

9. Recommendations and Results - Based on our analysis, we can make a recommendation to the e-commerce company on whether to roll out the new landing page to all users. We can also provide insights on which features or user behaviors are most predictive of conversions, and suggest additional experiments or tests to further improve the website's performance.
