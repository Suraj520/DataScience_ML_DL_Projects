> Case study on predictive maintenance system for industrial machinery.

Problem Statement: An industrial manufacturing company has a fleet of machines that are critical to their operations. Downtime due to machine breakdowns leads to significant losses in productivity and revenue. The company wants to implement a predictive maintenance system that can alert them to potential machine failures before they occur, allowing maintenance teams to perform preventative maintenance and minimize downtime.

Data Collection: Data will be collected from sensors on the machines that capture information about their performance and usage. This data will be stored in a database and will include variables such as machine age, operating temperature, vibration levels, and maintenance history.

Data Pre-processing: The data will need to be pre-processed to remove missing values and outliers, and to scale the variables appropriately. Any irrelevant variables will also be removed.

Feature Engineering: New features will be created from the existing variables, such as rolling averages, cumulative sums, and time-based variables. These engineered features will provide additional information about the machine's behavior that can be used to train the predictive model.

EDA: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) will be performed to gain insights into the data, identify any patterns or trends, and visualize the relationships between the variables. This will inform the feature engineering process and help to identify any issues with the data that need to be addressed.

Model Selection: Several machine learning models will be considered, including decision trees, random forests, and neural networks. The models will be evaluated using cross-validation and the best performing model will be selected.


Model Tuning: The selected model will be fine-tuned by adjusting hyperparameters using grid search and cross-validation. The goal is to find the optimal combination of hyperparameters that will maximize the performance of the model.

Model Interpretation: Once the final model is trained and deployed, its predictions will be interpreted and analyzed to gain insights into the factors that contribute to machine failures. This can help the company to make informed decisions about maintenance schedules, replacement parts, and other factors that affect machine performance. Overall, this predictive maintenance system will enable the company to minimize downtime, improve efficiency, and reduce maintenance costs, leading to significant improvements in their bottom line.
