> Employee Retention case study.

1. Problem statement: A large company wants to analyze employee retention and identify factors that contribute to employee turnover. The company has a high turnover rate and wants to understand why employees are leaving and what they can do to reduce turnover.

2. Data collection: The company collects data on employee demographics, job role, performance metrics, salary, benefits, and other factors that may affect employee retention. They also track which employees have left the company and when.

3. Data pre-processing: The data is cleaned, pre-processed, and transformed into a format that can be used for machine learning. This includes converting categorical variables into numerical variables and handling missing values.

4. Feature engineering: Additional features are created based on the existing data. For example, the ratio of salary to the industry average can be calculated to determine if the employee is being paid fairly.

5. Exploratory data analysis (EDA): The data is analyzed to understand the distribution of each variable, the correlation between variables, and to identify outliers and missing values.

6. Model selection: Various machine learning models are trained on the data, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks. The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

7. Feature importance: The most important features that contribute to employee turnover are identified using techniques such as permutation feature importance and SHAP values.

8. Model interpretation: The models are interpreted to understand how each variable affects the probability of an employee leaving. For example, the analysis may show that employees who are paid below industry average and have a low performance score are more likely to leave.

9. Recommendations: The analysis provides insights on how the company can improve employee retention. For example, the company can offer competitive salaries, provide better training and development opportunities, or improve work-life balance to reduce stress and improve job satisfaction.

10. Result: By using machine learning to analyze employee retention, the company can identify factors that contribute to turnover and take proactive measures to retain employees. This can result in cost savings from not having to constantly hire and train new employees, as well as improved employee morale and productivity.
