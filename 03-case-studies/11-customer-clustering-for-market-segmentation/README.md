> Case study on clustering customers for market segmentation.

- Introduction:
In this case study, we will be using a Kaggle dataset on customer data to perform clustering analysis for market segmentation. Market segmentation is a process of dividing a market into distinct groups of customers with similar characteristics, behaviors, and preferences. Clustering analysis is a popular technique in machine learning that can be used to group customers based on their similarities or dissimilarities, allowing businesses to tailor their marketing strategies and offerings to better target specific customer segments.

- Dataset:
The dataset used in this case study is the "Customer Segmentation" dataset, which can be found on Kaggle via the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python

This dataset contains information about 850 customers, including their annual income (in thousands of dollars), spending score (a measure of their spending behavior), and age. The goal of this case study is to segment the customers into distinct groups based on their income, spending score, and age.

- Data Collection:
The first step in any data analysis project is data collection. In this case study, the dataset was obtained from Kaggle, a popular platform for machine learning competitions and data science projects. The dataset is in the form of a CSV file, which can be loaded into a Python environment for further analysis.

- Preprocessing:
Once the dataset is collected, the next step is to preprocess the data. This involves cleaning and transforming the data to ensure that it is in a suitable format for analysis. In this case study, the preprocessing steps may include handling missing values, data formattin and data scaling.

- Feature Engineering - In this step, We will create new features that maybe more informative for clustering. Also, We may reduce the dimensionality of the dataset by transforming the original features into a smaller set of orthogonal features.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
EDA is an important step in any data analysis project as it helps to gain insights into the data and understand its underlying patterns and trends. We'll apply Descriptive statistics, data visualisation techniques for the same. We'll also try to perform correlation analysis.

- Model selection - Once the data is preprocessed and explored through EDA, The next step is to select a suitable clustering algorithm for the analysis. There are several popular clustering algorithms like K-Means, Hierarchial Clustering and DB Scan. We'll try to perform these and evaluate the results.

- Model tuning - The best performing model's hyperparameter will be tuned. In k-means, It's the number of clusters. We'll use elbow method for the same.

- Model interpretations - Once the best model is fitted and tuned, The next step is to interpret the results of the analysis. This involves understanding the characteristics and behavious of the different customer clusters identified by the model.

- Recommendations and Results - Based on the insights obtained from the clustering analysis, Businesses can make recommendations and develop tailored marketing strategies for different customer segments.
