> Customer churn analysis case study.

Problem statement: A telecom company wants to analyze customer churn and identify factors that contribute to customer attrition. The company has a high churn rate and wants to understand why customers are leaving and what they can do to reduce churn.

Data collection: The company collects data on customer demographics, usage patterns, billing information, customer service interactions, and other factors that may affect churn. They also track which customers have left the company and when.

Data pre-processing: The data is cleaned, pre-processed, and transformed into a format that can be used for machine learning. This includes converting categorical variables into numerical variables and handling missing values.

Feature engineering: Additional features are created based on the existing data. For example, the length of time the customer has been with the company can be calculated based on the account creation date and current date.

Exploratory data analysis (EDA): The data is analyzed to understand the distribution of each variable, the correlation between variables, and to identify outliers and missing values.

Model selection: Various machine learning models are trained on the data, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks. The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Feature importance: The most important features that contribute to customer churn are identified using techniques such as permutation feature importance and SHAP values.

Model interpretation: The models are interpreted to understand how each variable affects the probability of a customer leaving. For example, the analysis may show that customers who have high monthly bills and low customer service ratings are more likely to churn.

Recommendations: The analysis provides insights on how the company can improve customer retention. For example, the company can offer promotions or discounts to customers who have been with the company for a long time, provide better customer service, or improve billing transparency.

Result: By using machine learning to analyze customer churn, the company can identify factors that contribute to attrition and take proactive measures to retain customers. This can result in cost savings from not having to constantly acquire new customers, as well as improved customer satisfaction and loyalty.
