    "> Convolutional neural networks\n",
    "\n",
    "A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a deep learning architecture that is highly efficient for processing visual data such as images. They aim to automatically learn the appropriate features from the input data using convolution and pooling layers, followed by fully connected layers for classification. \n",
    "\n",
    "CNN Math:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Convolution Operation: Convolution operation is the basic element of CNN. It involves applying convolutional filters/kernels to input data, typically images or feature maps from previous layers, to extract local patterns or features. The convolution operation is mathematically defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a two-dimensional input (image) represented as an H x W (height x width) matrix and a convolutional filter/kernel of size K x K, where K is usually an odd number. The convolution operation involves a dot product between the input data and a filter/kernel at each possible location (i, j) of the input data, resulting in a feature map or output activation in dimension (H - K + 1) x Graph. (W - K + 1 ).\n",
    "\n",
    "The convolution operation can be expressed mathematically as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "output[i, j] = sum(sum(input[i:i+K, j:j+K] * filter))\n",
    "where Input[i:i+K, j:j+K] represents the local region of the input data to be convoluted with the filter and Filter is the convolution filter/kernel. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Pooling operation: The Pooling operation is used to reduce the spatial dimension of the feature map while preserving important features. The most commonly used pool operation is max pooling, which selects the maximum value from a local region of the feature map. The pooling operation is usually applied after the convolution operation, and its mathematical definition is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "output[i, j] = max (input[i:i+K, j:j+K])\n",
    "Among them, Input[i:i+K, j:j+K] represents the local area of ​​the feature map, and max is the maximum pool operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Fully Connected Layers: After one or more convolution and pooling layers, the feature map is flattened into a one-dimensional vector and passed through one or more fully connected layers. These layers are similar to those in a traditional feedforward neural network, where each neuron is connected to all neurons in the previous and subsequent layers. The output of the last fully connected layer is used for classification."
