> Deep Learning

Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that focuses on modeling complex patterns and representations in large amounts of data using artificial neural networks. This is called "deep" learning because it involves training a multilayer neural network (also known as a deep neural network) to learn a hierarchical representation of data.

Let's have a look at various key concepts in deep learning which are explained and implemented using Tensorflow/Keras deep learning framework.
