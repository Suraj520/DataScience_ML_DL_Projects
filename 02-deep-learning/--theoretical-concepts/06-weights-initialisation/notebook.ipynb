    "> Weight Initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "Weight initialization refers to the process of setting initial values ​​for the neural network weights before training. The choice of initial weights can significantly affect the convergence and performance of the network during training. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, gradient initialization is the process of initializing gradients of network parameters (including weights) to appropriate values ​​before training begins. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is usually done to avoid problems such as vanishing or exploding gradients that can hinder the optimization process during training. \n",
    "\n",
    "Weight initialization and gradient initialization are related in the sense that both aim to set appropriate initial values ​​for neural network parameters to ensure effective training. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "But they differ in specific goals and techniques. Weight initialization focuses on setting initial values ​​of weights in a way that helps improve network convergence and performance. This can include methods such as setting the weights to zero, initializing with random values, or using specialized methods such as Xavier or He initialization that take into account the network architecture and activation functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient initialization, on the other hand, focuses on setting the initial values ​​of the parameters (including weights) of the gradient to appropriate values ​​before training begins. This can include things like setting gradients to zero or initializing them with small values ​​to prevent exploding gradients, or using techniques like Scaled Exponential Linear Unit (SELU) to stabilize gradients during training. \n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, Although weight initialization and gradient initialization involve setting initial values ​​to neural network parameters, they differ in their specific goals and methods. The purpose of weight initialization is to set appropriate initial values ​​of weights to improve the convergence and performance of the network, while gradient initialization focuses on setting appropriate initial values ​​for the parameter gradient to ensure stable and efficient optimization during training. Both are important steps in the training process that can significantly affect the performance of a neural network.\n"
