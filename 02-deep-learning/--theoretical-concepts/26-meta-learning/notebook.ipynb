    "> Meta learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Meta-training, also known as \"learning to learn\", is a machine learning approach that aims to enable a model to learn to adapt and generalize to different tasks or domains for which data from the target task or domain is limited or unavailable. Field. In other words, meta-training focuses on training a model so that it learns to learn efficiently by improving its performance in new, unseen tasks or domains by using previous experience with related tasks or domains. \n",
    "\n",
    "Metalearning is often used in scenarios where data availability is limited and it may not be possible to collect large amounts of labeled data for each target task or domain. Meta-learning algorithms typically consist of two levels of learning: the meta level and the task level.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Meta-level learning: In the meta-level, the model learns to adapt to different tasks or domains by observing and learning from a set of related tasks or domains in the meta-training phase. This process helps the modeler develop a general understanding of the underlying structures or patterns that are common across tasks or domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Task-level learning: At the task level, the model uses learned meta-knowledge to quickly adapt to new, unseen tasks or domains with limited data during the metatest or inference phase. It involves using learned prior knowledge to make predictions or decisions about new tasks or domains with minimal additional training data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Meta-learning has been used successfully in a variety of fields, including computer vision, natural language processing, and robotics. It shows promising data-scarce scenarios and requires rapid model adaptation and generalization to new tasks or domains with limited data."
