    " #### About\n",
    " 1. CycleGAN attempts to learn a mapping from one dataset to another like a dataset of plants to dataset of faces.\n",
    " 2. It does this with two generators G and F and two discriminators Dx and Dy.\n",
    " 3. G attempts to turn dataset A into dataset B and F attempts to turn dataset B into dataset A.\n",
    " 4. Dx is used to differentiate real images sampled from Dataset A and images generated by generator F. F is updated to get better at fooling Dx\n",
    " 5. Dy is used to differentiate real images sampled from Dataset B and images generated by generator G. G is updated to get better at fooling Dy.\n",
    " 6. Introduction of cycle loss is made to ensure an image that is yielded by generator can be mapped back to original image by other generator.\n",
    " 7. Introduction of identity loss is made to help preserve tint. It ensures that when an image of target class is given, Generator yields the same image.\n",
    " 8. A series of conv layers and residual layers are used in generator to map one image to another.\n",
    " 9. PatchGAN architecture is used to classify images via Discriminator."
