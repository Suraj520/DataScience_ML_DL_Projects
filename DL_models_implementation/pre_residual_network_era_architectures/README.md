> > These contains jupyter notebook implementations of deep learning architectures which obtained great accuracy on ImageNet dataset prior the introuduction of ResNets in 2015.
> > > They were discontinued as they suffered from degradations in terms of model's training/test accuracy while increasing the number of layers to capture semantically strong features.
