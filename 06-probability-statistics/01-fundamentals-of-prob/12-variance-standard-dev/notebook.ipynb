    "> Variance and standard deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Variance and standard deviation are measures of the spread or dispersion of a set of data. They are commonly used in statistics to describe the variability of a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Variance is a measure of how far a set of data points are spread out from their mean(avg) value. It is calculated by taking the avg. of the sqrd. differences between each data point and mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Std. Deviation is the square root of the variance. It is a measure of the spread or dispersion of the dataset. It tells us how much the data deviates from the mean on average.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use cases of variance and std. deviation in real world\n",
    "1. Finance - Std. deviation is used to measure the risk associated with an investment. The higher the std. deviation, The riskier is the investment considered to be.\n",
    "2. Quality control - variance and std. deviation are used to measure the variability of a prod. process. A higher variance or std. deviation indicates that the process is not consistent and needs to be improved.\n",
    "3. Health - std. deviation is used to measure the variability of bio. data such as blood pressure or glucose levels. A high std. dev may indicate that a patient's health is not stable and needs to be monitored."
