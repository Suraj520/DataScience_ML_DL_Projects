    "> Marginal probability\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is a statistical concept that describes the probability distribution of a single random variable from a joint probability distribution. \n",
    "- It shows the prob. of one variable independently, without considering other variables.\n",
    "- It is obtained by summing(discrete) or integrating(continuos) the joint prob distribution over all possible values of other variable\n",
    "- Use cases in real world\n",
    "1. Medical diagnosis - It is used to estimate the prob. of a patient having a particular symptom or disease independently. For ex - Doctor can use marginal prob of blood pressure to diagnose a patient with high bp without considering other diseases.\n",
    "2. Insurance claims - It is used to estimate the probability of a single event occuring such as prob of a car accident or a house fire.\n",
    "3. Customer analysis - It is used to analyse customer behaviour by considering the prob of single event, such as prob of customer making a purchase or clicking on an adv.\n",
