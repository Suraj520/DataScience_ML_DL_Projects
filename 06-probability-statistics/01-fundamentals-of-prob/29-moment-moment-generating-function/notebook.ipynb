    "The moment generating function (MGF) is a tool used in probability theory to find moments of probability distributions. It is defined as the expected value of the exponential of a random variable multiplied by a parameter t.\n",
    "\n",
    "The moment generating function of a random variable X is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "M_X(t) = E[e^(tX)]\n",
    "\n",
    "The MGF is used to derive moments of the distribution of the random variable X. Specifically, the nth moment of X can be obtained by taking the nth derivative of the MGF and evaluating it at t=0:\n",
    "\n",
    "M_X^n(0) = E[X^n]\n",
    "\n",
    "The MGF can be used to find the mean, variance, and other moments of a probability distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the important use cases of the moment generating function is that it can be used to determine the distribution of a sum of independent random variables. Specifically, if X and Y are independent random variables with MGFs M_X(t) and M_Y(t), then the MGF of their sum X+Y is the product of their MGFs:\n",
