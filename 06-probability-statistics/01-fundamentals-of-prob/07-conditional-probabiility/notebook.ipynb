    "> Conditional Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional probability is a fundamental concept in probability theory, which describes the probability of an event A given that another event B has occurred. It is denoted by P(A | B), and it represents the probability of A occurring, given that B has already occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, the conditional probability of A given B can be calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(A | B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B)\n",
    "\n",
    "where P(A ∩ B) represents the probability of both A and B occurring together, and P(B) represents the probability of B occurring."
