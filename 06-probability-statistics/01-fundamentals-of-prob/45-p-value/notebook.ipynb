    "\n",
    "p-value is a statistical measure used to determine the significance of results obtained in a statistical hypothesis test. It is the probability of obtaining a result as extreme or more extreme than the one observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true. If the p-value is below a certain significance level (usually 0.05), we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a statistically significant difference or relationship between variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The use cases of p-value include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis testing: p-value is commonly used to test hypotheses in fields such as biology, psychology, economics, and engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model selection: p-value can be used to compare the performance of different models and select the one with the best fit to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature selection: p-value can be used to identify the most significant features in a dataset and select the ones that are most relevant for a particular task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quality control: p-value can be used to monitor the quality of a manufacturing process by testing whether the product meets certain specifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Risk assessment: p-value can be used to assess the risk of certain events, such as a disease outbreak or a financial crisis."
