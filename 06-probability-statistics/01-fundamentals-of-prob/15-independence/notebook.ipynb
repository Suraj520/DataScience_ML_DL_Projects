    "> Independence\n",
    "\n",
    "- Independence is a statistical concept that describes the relationship between two random variables. Two random variables X and Y are said to be independent if the occurence of one event does not affect the prob of the occurence of the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "- P(X=x,Y=y) = P(X=x) * P(Y=y)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use cases\n",
    "1. Coin toss - The toss of a coin : Prob of getting heads on the first toss doesn't depend on the outcome of the second toss and vice versa.\n",
    "2. Medical tests - Results of multiple tests are often used to make a diagnosis. If the tests are independent, The prob of a disease can be calculated as prod of prob of each test being positive.\n",
    "3. Weather - In forecasting, The temp and precipitation are two indep. variables. The occurence of rain doesn't depend on temp and vice versa."
