#### Descriptive Statistics

It is the branch of statistics that deals with the collection, analysis and interpretation of data. It involves the use of various techniques to summarize and describe the important features of a dataset.

The goal of descriptive statistics is to provide a clear and concise summary of the data that can be easily understood and interpreted. It can be used to gain insights into a dataset and to identify pattern and trends. It can also be used to identify outliers, assess the normality of the data, and identify potential sources of bias or errors in the data.
