    "Measures of association are statistical techniques used to determine the strength and direction of the relationship between two or more variables. They are used to explore the degree to which changes in one variable are associated with changes in another variable. The commonly used measures of association are correlation and regression.\n",

    "Correlation is a measure of association between two continuous variables. It indicates the strength and direction of the linear relationship between the two variables. Correlation can range from -1 to 1, with -1 indicating a strong negative correlation, 0 indicating no correlation, and 1 indicating a strong positive correlation.\n",
