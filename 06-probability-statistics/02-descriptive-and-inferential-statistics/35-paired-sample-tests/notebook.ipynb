    "Paired sample tests are a type of statistical test used to compare the means or differences between two related or matched samples. The samples are considered paired because they come from the same individuals or subjects, and the pairing is based on some characteristic or factor that is common to both samples.\n",

    "For example, suppose we want to compare the effectiveness of two different weight loss programs on the same group of individuals. We could use a paired sample test to compare the weight loss results of each individual after completing each program, with the pairing based on each individual's weight loss from the first program.\n",
