    "Power analysis is a statistical technique used to determine the probability of correctly rejecting a null hypothesis when it is in fact false. In other words, it determines the probability of detecting an effect or relationship between variables if it actually exists.\n",

We plan to take a random sample of 50 chickens from the population and test their weights. We want to determine the statistical power of this test, which is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis if the true mean weight is actually different from 2.5 kg.\n",
