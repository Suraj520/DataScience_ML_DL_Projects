#### Descriptive Statistics

- It is the branch of statistics that deals with the collection, analysis and interpretation of data. It involves the use of various techniques to summarize and describe the important features of a dataset.

- The goal of descriptive statistics is to provide a clear and concise summary of the data that can be easily understood and interpreted. It can be used to gain insights into a dataset and to identify pattern and trends. It can also be used to identify outliers, assess the normality of the data, and identify potential sources of bias or errors in the data.

#### Inferential Statistics

- Inferential statistics is a branch of statistics that involves using statistical methods to draw conclusions or make inferences about a population based on a sample of data. The main goal of inferential statistics is to make generalizations about a population based on the analysis of a smaller group of individuals or data points.

- Inferential statistics is used to test hypotheses and make predictions about the behavior of a population based on the behavior of a sample from that population. It involves calculating probabilities and using statistical tests to determine whether the results of a sample are likely to be representative of the population as a whole.

- Examples of inferential statistics include hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression analysis.
