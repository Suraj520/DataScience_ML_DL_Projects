    "> Normal Distribution and Z-scores\n",
    "\n",
    "- Normal Distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution or bell curve, is a probability distribution that is widely used in statistics to model real-world phenomena such as height, weight, and test scores. The distribution has a symmetric, bell-shaped curve and is characterized by two parameters: the mean and the standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Z-score, also known as standard score, is a measure of how many standard deviations an observation or data point is away from the mean of the population. Z-scores are often used in statistical analysis to compare individual observations or data points across different datasets.\n",
