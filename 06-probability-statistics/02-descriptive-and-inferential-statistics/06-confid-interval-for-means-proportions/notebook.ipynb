    "Confidence intervals are a statistical tool used to estimate the range of values within which a population parameter is likely to fall with a certain level of confidence. In particular, confidence intervals for means and proportions are used to estimate the range of values within which the true mean or proportion of a population is likely to fall based on a sample.\n",

We can randomly select a sample of apples from the farm and compute the sample mean weight. However, the sample mean weight is likely to differ from the true population mean weight. We can construct a confidence interval to estimate the range of values within which the true population mean weight is likely to fall.\n"
