    "Paired t-test is a statistical test used to determine whether there is a significant difference between two related samples. It is used when the samples being compared are not independent of each other, i.e., they are paired. In other words, the paired t-test is used when the same individuals are measured or tested twice, and the differences between the two measurements or tests are being evaluated.\n",
