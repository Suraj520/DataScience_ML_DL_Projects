# About

> This project uses MobileNetV2-SSDLite Architecture for detecting vehicle number plate on the Kaggle dataset: https://https//www.kaggle.com/dataturks/vehicle-number-plate-detection

### Current Feature Update
> It is a bare-minimum backbone of Mobilenet v2-SSDLite where the bounding box coordinates are being regressed. 

If you want a much accurate model of this with NMS and AnchorBox Generation module added to it, feel free to drop a mail at hrishabhsuraj52@gmail.com
