# About
> > These contains jupyter notebook implementations of deep learning architectures which obtained great accuracy on ImageNet dataset prior the introuduction of ResNets in 2015.
> > > They were discontinued as they suffered from degradations in terms of model's training/test accuracy while increasing the number of layers to capture semantically strong features.

Note: These are implemented using keras and only AlexNet has been trained on a subset of ImageNet classes, rest all architectures can easily be fitted by replacing AlexNet model class with desired class i.e VGGNet or MobileNet.
