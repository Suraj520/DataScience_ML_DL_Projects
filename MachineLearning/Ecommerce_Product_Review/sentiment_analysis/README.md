## About the Project
This is a sentiment analysis of eBay Product Reviews. Using python, We will build a system capable of deciphering the sentiment analysis of any future review.

## Industrial Usecase 
Reviews help in analysing the outcome of a newly launched product or services on an e-commerce platform. It's useful to improve product during the journey so that the negative reviews on it decrease and eventually business is carved out of it. It's mostly used by marketing agencies for performing targetted campaigning.

### Task

Create a function between independent variable Review sentences and dependent variable - positive or negative review (boolean). It mostly boils down to using the function to assign positive or negative values to keywords extracted within reviews. The polynomial function is obtained after training or fitting the model on labelled reviews data on e-commerce platforms like Flipkart, Amazon, Myntra, ebay etc.

#### Approach
1. A basic approach involves training a machine learning model on labelled positive and negative keywords that upon being encountered in a future review sequentially gets summed up to decipher the net sentiment.

2. Using TF-IDF.                    

3. Using Count Vectorizer.
