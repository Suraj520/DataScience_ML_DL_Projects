    "> Introduction to fairing\n",
    "\n",
    "- kubeflow fairing is a tool that helps us train ml models on kubernetes which is a system for managing containerized apps.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It simplifies the process of building, training and deploying models on kubernetes, making it easier for DS and ML engs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fairing supports various ml frameworks like Tf, Pytorch and scikit learn, however it can be configured to work with any framework\n",
    "\n",
    "> Building and deploying models with fairing\n",
    "\n",
    "- With fairing, we can build ml models and automatically containerize it, creating a container image that can be deployed on kubernetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fairing can be easily integrated into kubeflow pipelines\n",
