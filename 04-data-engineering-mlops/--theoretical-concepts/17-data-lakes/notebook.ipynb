    "> Data Lakes\n",
    "\n",
    "A data lake is a large centralized repository that allows you to store all structured and unstructured data at any scale. The concept of a data lake is similar to that of a real lake. Water enters the lake from various sources and users can draw water as needed. Similarly, in a data lake, data comes from various sources such as IoT devices, websites, applications, social media and many more. This data is stored in a raw format, and you can use different types of analytics to gain insights. \n",
    "\n",
    "Data lakes offer several advantages such as flexibility, scalability and cost-effectiveness. Since the data is stored in its original format, you don't need to spend time and resources to convert the data to a specific format. In addition, data lakes can handle large amounts of data, and you can easily scale them up or down as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a data lake, you can also perform different types of analysis, such as batch processing, real-time processing, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. For example, you can use batch processing to process large amounts of historical data, real-time processing to analyze generated data, machine learning to build predictive models, and AI to perform advanced analytics.\n",
