    "Hadoop is an open source framework for distributed storage and processing of large data sets on clusters of commodity hardware. It provides a cost-effective and scalable solution for big data processing. Hadoop consists of two main components: the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and MapReduce.\n",
    "\n",
    "HDFS is a distributed file system that can store data across multiple nodes in a cluster. It breaks large data sets into smaller chunks and distributes them across cluster nodes for storage. This approach makes data processing faster and more efficient, as data can be accessed in parallel on multiple nodes. MapReduce is a programming model for parallel processing of large data sets on Hadoop clusters. \n",
    "\n",
    "It consists of two phases: Map and Reduce. The map phase takes input data, processes it, and generates intermediate key-value pairs. The reducer stage takes the output from the map stage and combines the intermediate key-value pairs into the final output. Here is an example of how Hadoop MapReduce works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we have a large data set that contains sales transactions in a retail store. We want to calculate the total revenue that the store generates from each product category. For this we can use Hadoop MapReduce.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the map phase, we divide the data set into smaller chunks and distribute them to different nodes of the Hadoop cluster. Each node processes its own blocks of data and generates intermediate key-value pairs. For example, a node could process all transactions for the electronics category and output a key-value pair where the key is “electronics” and the value is the revenue generated by the electronics category. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the reducer phase, we merge the intermediate key-value pairs generated in the map phase to get the final result. For example, we could have a node that takes all intermediate key-value pairs for each product category, sums the revenue for each category, and produces a final output of the total revenue for each product category.
