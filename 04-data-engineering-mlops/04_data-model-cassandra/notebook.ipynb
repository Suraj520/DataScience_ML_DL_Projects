    "#### About\n",
    "1. What is Cassandra ?\n",
    "- Ans - Before understanding Cassandra, We have to understand Relational Database and NoSQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Relational Database, If a new entry to a table which has attributes STUDENT ID, NAME, LOCATION, GENDER, COLLEGE has to be made then it ought to have all the attributes in the entry else we can't do entry in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have to do the entry still, We will have to fill NA in that entry which shall waste space. Similarly, If we have an extra attribute named Activity of the candidate then we'll not be able to fill it in the DB.\n",
    "\n",
    "To convert these disadvantage into advantage, NoSQL is used. We'll pass only the known attributes for a candidate thereby removing the limitations of a relational database.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL can handle unstructred data, efficiently\n",
    "\n",
    "* There are 4 types of NoSQL database\n",
    "1. Key-Value Database.\n",
    "2. Column Database - Cassandra\n",
    "3. Document Database\n",
    "4. Graph Database.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Apache Cassandra is a distributed NoSQL Database. It is based on Peer to Peer architecture instead of its contrary master-slave architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It ensures high performance, large scalability and distributed. Number of nodes and computational nodes can increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cassandra handles all three types of data like Structred, Semi-Structred and Unstructred.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cassandra supports A(Atomicity), C(Consistency), I(Isolation) and D(Durability).\n",
    "\n",
    "- It's higly reliable due to data replicability. If the node fails then data can be retrieved from other nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It's open-source. It can be integrated with Apache HIVE, Hadoop etc. \n"

    "3. Run cassandra in CMD\n",
    "4. Run command sqlsh in other terminal\n",
