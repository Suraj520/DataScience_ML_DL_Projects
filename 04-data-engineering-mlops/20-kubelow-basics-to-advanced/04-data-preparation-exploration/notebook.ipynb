    "- Suppose we have a large dataset stored in an external database and we want to use it for training a ML model in kubeflow\n",
    "\n",
    "- We'll extract data from the external db using Apache NiFi or custom scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We'll eventually bring data into kubeflow env.\n",

    "2. `Data Transformation`\n",
    "\n",
    "- The raw data from database contains categorcal variables that need to be encoded for ML.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We'll transform the data within kubeflow by encoding cat variables, scaling numerical features and handling any missing values via kubeflow's data preprocessing cap.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `Data loading`\n",
    "\n",
    "- We'll want to store the transformed data into a specific format or location ence we'll use google bucket or equiv."
