> Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that involves the development of algorithms and statistical models that allow computers to automatically learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data without explicit programming. 

Machine learning algorithms use patterns and relationships found in data to make predictions, classify data into different categories, recognize patterns, and uncover insights or knowledge from large amounts of data. 

Machine learning has wide-ranging applications in various fields, such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, fraud detection, healthcare, finance, autonomous vehicles, and many more.

Let's have a look at few important concepts in Machine learning -
