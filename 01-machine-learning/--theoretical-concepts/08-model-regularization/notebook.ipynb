    "#### Model Regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "Model regularization in machine learning is a technique used to prevent overfitting, which occurs when a model is too complex and learns to remember the training data instead of generalizing from it. Regularization techniques add penalty terms to the model loss function during training to prevent overreliance on a single feature or combination of features and encourage the model to find simpler and more general patterns in the data. Several popular regularization techniques are used in machine learning, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. L1 regularization (Lasso regularization): This method adds a penalty to the model loss function that is proportional to the absolute value of the model coefficients. This encourages the model to use fewer features and can lead to parsimonious models in which some coefficients are zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. L2 Regularization (Ridge Regularization): This method adds a penalty to the model loss function that is proportional to the square of the model coefficients. This encourages the model to use smaller coefficient values, which helps eliminate overfitting and can result in smoother models. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Flexible net regularization. This technique combines L1 and L2 regularization by adding a penalty term that is a linear combination of the absolute value and the square of the model coefficients. It provides a balance between L1 and L2 regularization and is useful when there are multiple correlated features in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Dropout: This method randomly discards a certain percentage of neurons in the neural network during training, preventing them from contributing to the model's output. This helps prevent overfitting by forcing the model to rely on a different combination of neurons in each training iteration. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Early Stopping: This technique stops the training process before it reaches the maximum number of epochs based on the performance of the validation set. This prevents the model from overfitting by stopping training when its performance on the validation set begins to deteriorate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization techniques can effectively prevent overfitting and improve the generalization performance of machine learning models. They help create more robust models that generalize better to unseen data and are less prone to overreliance on noisy or irrelevant features."
