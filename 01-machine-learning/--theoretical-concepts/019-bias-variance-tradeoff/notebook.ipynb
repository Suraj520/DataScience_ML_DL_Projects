    "> Bias Variance Tradeoff.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bias-variance trade-off is a fundamental concept in machine learning that deals with the relationship between a model's bias and variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bias refers to the error that occurs when approximating a real-world problem with a simplified model. A large deviation means that the model is too simple and may not fit the data, resulting in poor performance and low accuracy. On the other hand, a low bias means that the model is more complex and may involve complex data patterns. Variance, on the other hand, refers to the variability of model predictions for different training data sets. High variance means that the model is too sensitive to the training data and may overfit, resulting in poor generalization to unseen data. Low variance means that the model is more stable and generalizes well to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bias-variance trade-off shows that when we reduce the bias of a model, we generally increase its variance and vice versa. Finding the right balance between bias and variance is critical to building good machine learning models that perform well on both training and test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, if our model is too simple (high bias), it may fail to capture the underlying patterns in the data, resulting in poor fit. On the other hand, if our model is too complex (low bias), it may memorize the training data, leading to overfitting and poor generalization to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to find a model that balances bias and variance, which can be achieved through proper model selection, feature engineering, regularization techniques, and hyperparameter tuning. When building machine learning models for optimal performance on unseen data, it is important to understand the trade-off between bias and variance."
