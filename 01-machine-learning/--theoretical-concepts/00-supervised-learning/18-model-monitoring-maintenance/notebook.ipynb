    "\n",
    "Model monitoring and maintenance are important aspects of supervised machine learning to ensure that trained models continue to perform well and provide accurate predictions as new data becomes available. Model monitoring involves tracking the performance and behavior of the trained model in production, while model maintenance involves making necessary updates or improvements to the model to address any issues or changes in the data environment.\n",

    "> Steps to perform model monitoring and maintenance\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Monitoring: Once a supervised learning model is deployed in a production environment, it's important to monitor its performance over time. We can track various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, or area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, to evaluate the model's performance. We can also monitor for data drift, which refers to changes in the distribution or characteristics of the input data that can impact the model's performance. Monitoring can be done using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or custom scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Maintenance: If any issues are detected during monitoring or if there are changes in the data environment, model maintenance may be required. This can involve retraining the model with updated data, tuning hyperparameters, or updating the model architecture. For example, if data drift is detected, We may need to update the model to adapt to the changing data distribution.\n",
