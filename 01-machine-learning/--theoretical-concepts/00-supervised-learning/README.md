> Supervised Machine Learning

Supervised machine learning is a type of machine learning where an algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, which consists of input-output pairs, also known as labeled examples or training data. 

In supervised learning, the algorithm learns to make predictions or decisions based on patterns and relationships observed in the labeled data. The goal is to find a mapping between input features and their corresponding output labels, so that the algorithm can generalize and make accurate predictions on new, unseen data.

A supervised learning procedure typically involves the following steps - Data collection, Data preprocessing, Model training, Model evaluation and Model deployment.

Let's have a look at few key concepts that are present in supervised learning.
