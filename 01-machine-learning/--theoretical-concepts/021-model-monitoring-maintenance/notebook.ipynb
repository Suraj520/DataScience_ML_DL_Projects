    "> Model monitoring and maintenance\n",
    "\n",
    "Model monitoring and maintenance are critical steps in the lifecycle of machine learning models to ensure their continued performance, accuracy, and reliability. Once a machine learning model is deployed in production, it must be continuously monitored and maintained to ensure that it performs as intended and provides accurate predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Model monitoring involves regularly tracking and evaluating the performance of implemented models. This includes monitoring various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score and other relevant evaluation metrics to evaluate the performance of the model on real data. Monitoring may also include tracking model input data, output predictions, and other related data to detect any anomalies or changes in data patterns that may affect model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model maintenance involves taking corrective actions to correct any problems discovered during model monitoring. This may include retraining the model with updated data, refining hyperparameters, or optimizing the model for better performance. Model maintenance also involves addressing issues related to data quality, data drift, concept drift, and degradation of model performance over time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Model monitoring and maintenance also involves addressing issues related to fairness, ethics, and bias in model predictions. This includes regularly monitoring the bias and fairness of model forecasts and taking corrective actions to mitigate any biases that may exist in model forecasts."
