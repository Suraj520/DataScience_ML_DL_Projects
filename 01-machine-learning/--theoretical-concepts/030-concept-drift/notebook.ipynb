    "> Concept drift.\n",
    "\n",
    "Concept drift, also known as concept shift or data drift, is the phenomenon where the underlying distribution or concept of the data used to train a machine learning model changes over time or across different datasets. In other words, the statistical properties of the data, such as the distribution of features, the distribution of classes, or the relationship between variables, can change, causing the model to perform worse. Concept drift can occur in many real-world scenarios, including online advertising, financial markets, sensor networks, customer behavior analysis, and medical diagnostics. This can be caused by a number of factors, such as changes in user preferences, seasonal changes, changes in market conditions, changes in data collection procedures, or sensor degradation. Concept bias poses challenges for machine learning models because a model trained on a single dataset may not perform well on new or unseen data with different underlying distributions. This is because model assumptions, learning models, and decision boundaries may no longer be valid in the new data environment. Concept bias reduces model accuracy, increases false positives/false negatives, and degrades model performance over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to handle the operation of the concept:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Retraining: Regularly updating the model with new data helps to adapt to changing concepts. This may involve retraining the entire model or simply updating individual components or parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Incremental Learning: Incremental or online learning techniques allow the model to learn from new data as it becomes available without retraining the entire model from scratch. This can help models adapt to real-time or near-real-time concept operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Ensemble methods: Ensemble methods, such as ensemble classifiers or model ensembles, can be used to combine predictions from multiple models trained on different time periods or data distributions. This can help reduce concept bias by taking advantage of model diversity. \n",
    "4. Monitoring and detection. Monitoring changes in statistical properties or data patterns can help identify concept bias. Statistical methods, domain-specific rules, or change detection algorithms can be used to identify changes in the data distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Adaptation techniques: Adaptation techniques such as domain adaptation or transfer learning can be used to transfer knowledge from the source domain (where the model is trained) to the target domain (where the model is implemented). This can help the model adapt to new data environments. \n",
    "6. Data pre-processing. To reduce the effects of concept bias, preprocessing techniques such as feature engineering, normalization, or data augmentation can be used to make the data more robust to changes in the distribution. \n",
    "7. Active learning. Active learning techniques involve sampling information for model updates based on uncertainty or confidence in the model. This helps to prioritize samples that may be affected by concept bias and improves the adaptability of the model to changing data distributions."
